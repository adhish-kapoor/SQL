              ====================
Q1 What are Constraints in SQL?
- Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table. 
It can be applied for single or multiple fields in an SQL table during the creation of the table or after creating using the ALTER TABLE command.

NOT NULL - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
CHECK - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
DEFAULT - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
UNIQUE - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field.
INDEX - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records.
PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
FOREIGN KEY - Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.

Q2 What is an Index?
- A database index is a data structure that provides a quick lookup of data in a column or columns of a table. 
It enhances the speed of operations accessing data from a database table at the cost of additional writes and memory to maintain the index data structure.

CREATE INDEX index_name   /* Create Index */
ON table_name (column_1, column_2);
DROP INDEX index_name;   /* Drop Index */

Q3 What is the difference between Clustered and Non-clustered index?
- Clustered index modifies the way records are stored in a database based on the indexed column. 
A non-clustered index creates a separate entity within the table which references the original table.

Clustered index is used for easy and speedy retrieval of data from the database, whereas, 
fetching records from the non-clustered index is relatively slower.

In SQL, a table can have a single clustered index whereas it can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

Q4 What is an Alias in SQL?
- An alias is a feature of SQL that is supported by most, if not all, RDBMSs. 
It is a temporary name assigned to the table or table column for the purpose of a particular SQL query.
In addition, aliasing can be employed as an obfuscation technique to secure the real names of database fields. 
A table alias is also called a correlation name.

Q5 What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE statements?
- The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.
The DELETE command deletes only the rows from the table based on the condition given in the where clause or 
deletes all the rows from the table if no condition is specified. But it does not free the space containing the table.
